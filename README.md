# Ransomware Simulator  

A Python-based Ransomware Simulator created for educational and testing purposes. This project helps demonstrate how ransomware works, enabling better understanding and preparedness against such threats.  

**⚠️ For Ethical and Educational Use Only.**

---

## Features  
- Simulates file encryption and decryption processes.  
- User-configurable encryption keys.  
- Targets specific file types and directories.  
- Displays a simulated ransom note.  
- Reversible encryption with a valid decryption key.  

---

## How It Works  
1. **Encryption**  
   - Files in the targeted directory are encrypted using a symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g., AES).  
2. **Ransom Note**  
   - A simulated ransom message is generated, notifying the user about encrypted files.  
3. **Decryption**  
   - Files can be decrypted using the correct decryption key provided during the simulation.
